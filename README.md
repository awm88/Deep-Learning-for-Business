# Deep-Learning-for-Business
The first assignment is to code and train a neural network in Python using only NumPy. This is in the file 'mmai 5500 assignment deep learning final.py'
The second assignment is where I implemented the deep portfolio method to find the 10 most communal stocks and the 20 least communal stocks. This is in the file 'copy_of_deep_learning_assignment_2_finalll_2ipynb (1).py'.
The third assignment is where I did the following:
1. Reproduce the IBB: plot a comparision of the portfolio (from assignment 2) and the IBB on the validation data.
2. Create a modified IBB where all returns less than -5% are replaced by 5%.
3. Select a new portfolio based on the modified IBB.
4. Reproduce the modified IBB: plot a comparison of the new portfolio and the modified IBB on the validation data.
This is in the file 'official deep learning 3-Copy1 finallllllllllllllll (1).py'
